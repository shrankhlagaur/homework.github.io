<p>Three out of every five persons need glasses to correct the vision to some degree. It means most of us are either born with poor vision or more exposed to screens. So what do we have to do now? Well, buying specs is so easy. All we have to do is pick the right pair of prescription glasses or sunglasses, along with some preventive measures. That is why here are some tips for choosing prescription glasses online: </p>
<br>
<h2>Correct Prescription</h2>
<p>Before buying prescription glasses, we must have an updated prescription. Otherwise, specs according to the wrong prescription might irritate the eyesight, and we’ll have a headache due to that. Besides this, our vision might get affected in the long term. So always remember before buying glasses, you must have a prescription. </p>
<h2>Select a Stylish Frame</h2>
<p>Online shopping of prescription glasses makes it easier for us to try hundreds of frames. All you have to do is choose eyeglasses that complement your facial features and overall look. While checking the styles of frame, don’t forget to check important features of the frames like durability, long-lasting, more comfortable to carry., etc.</p>
<p>For helping you in choosing the best frames, the human face is categorised into four basic shapes:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>Those who have sharper cheekbones, a narrow chin, and a broad forehead, should buy round-shaped frames.</li>
<li>People with round face must select wider or rectangular frames. These frames make your face look elongated. </li>
<li>If you have a square face, then you must go for softer or rounder frames so that you’ll be able to balance the sharp facial features.</li>
<li>Last but not least, if you have an oval face structure, then any type of glasses will work for you. Still, the personal suggestions would be to avoid rigid structure glasses that have round bottoms. </li>
    </ul>
<p>Different glasses have different parts to best suit your face structure. </p>
<h2>Glasses With Best Fitting</h2>
<p>Buying glasses that perfectly fit our face, boost our confidence. Just as lenses are crucial for our eyesight, the same goes with frames. Frames must perfectly fit our faces. Consider the ideal length and shape, as mentioned above, which best suits your vision. While trying frames, check the frame from all angles. Choose a pair of glasses that help you look better without moving your head. </p>
<h2>Perfect Pair of Lenses</h2>
<p>Now the next tip is to find the perfect pair of lenses for yourself. The best part about buying online glasses is that you can take professionals’ help whenever you want. Only the right pair of lenses will protect your eyes from rays. Also, check the lens material that may include the following factors: appearance, vision, durability, safety, and lasting comfort. Consult the professionals of our online store to know which lenses will suit you best.</p> 
<h2>Purchase More than One Pair of Glasses</h2>
<p>If you are a newbie, mark that always purchase more than one pair of glasses. Why? Because if one of them gets broken, then your eyes won’t have to suffer and wait for another pair. Also, in terms of money, it will be cost-efficient.  Since buying more than one pair, you will save your shipping charges and other add-ons.  Purchasing prescribed glasses from online stores gives you the freedom to purchase several glasses for the price of one pair at a retailer store. </p>
