<h1>Five Key Trends in Data Science and Machine Learning Career in 2020</h1>
<p>Data science and machine learning have been in trend in 2019. No doubt, they will continue to be in trend in 2020 as well. Although there have been several job cuts, layoffs, and financial crises across the globe due to COVID-19, still there are few tech jobs that will likely be in high demand. Most of the businesses after the pandemic coronavirus have to adopt a new trend to continue their services. </p>
    <br>

<p>If you are a student or an employee indulging your career towards Data Science or Machine Learning will definitely give you a boost. Let's get into more details of key trends that will command in the Data Science and Machine Learning career in 2020.</p>
<h2>Shifting in Cloud</h2>
<p>Since a large number of companies are heading towards the cloud, the volume of piled up data is also increasing. This situation is pushing companies to invest in meaningful resources to not only store it but also get meaningful extraction out of it. That is why many organizations need data scientists to refine the stored data and use it deliberately. So we can say data science and cloud computing go hand in hand. </p>
<h2>Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
<p>IoT is basically the concept of connecting several devices together through the internet. It is like a giant network with connected devices that integrates data from different mediums and refines it through analytics.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="Images/iot2.jfif"; width= "700px"; height="500px";>
<p>So companies are relying on IoT for collecting and utilizing data for various purposes. It means IoT businesses will require someone who knows Data Science and Machine Learning and well aware of the IoT. </p>
<h2>Machine Learning as a Service</h2>
<p>In the current tech scenario, companies are relying on ML intelligence. Paas and  Iaas days are gone, now the new trend in the digital market is shifted to ML resources and MLaas model. The MLaas doesn't stop here; It will continue to lead data in forthcoming years.</p> 
    <br>
    <img src="Images/techno5.jfif"; width= "700px"; height="500px";>
<p>Amazon Machine Learning Services, Google Cloud AI, IBM Watson, Azure Machine Learning are four leading cloud MLaas that allow fast training and implementation. Thus those who have a certification or experience in MLaas will be highly eminent in the tech companies.</p> 
<h2>Predictive Analytics</h2>
<p>To understand the scenario better, let us first understand what does predictive analysis means? Predictive analysis means relying on past data to predict future consequences. What is this a weather forecast? </p>
    <br>
    <img src="Images/techno3.jfif"; width= "700px"; height="500px";>
<p>No, it merely means organizations are using their customers' data to offer similar deals in the future. For making predictions better in real-time, businesses are using platforms like  Saas and MLaas. So predictive analysis is a new trend in retail, healthcare, cybersecurity, and many other companies.</p> 
<h2>Open-Source Language Experts</h2>
<p>No matter how much we grow, free data still remains a wide arms necessity for small enterprises, startups, cloud, etc. For SMEs which are willing to gain, free software tools and data are like a part. Thus we will always see growth in this sector. So people who know computing languages like R, Python, Golang, a language with a basis on statistical computing will be required by SMEs.</p> 
    <br>
<img src="Images/techno4.jfif"; width= "700px"; height="500px";>
<p>These were some key trends in Data Science and Machine Learning, more of which we'll be seeing in forthcoming years. So newbies must consider these trends while making career choices. </p>
