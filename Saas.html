<h1>3 Reasons Why SaaS Is the Future of Business Process Automation</h1>
     <img src="Images/saas1.jfif"; width="600px"; height="400px";>
<p>Twenty years back from now, it was hard to imagine that things will be so smooth in future. To install an application, business firms have to use CD ROM or Floppy disks. Not only this, but they also have to face huge exponential costs to build their IT infrastructure. But now none can deny that technologies like Saas have made business easy for companies. </p>
    <br>
   
<p>Now you must be thinking, what is Saas?  Saas basically means Software-as-a-Service, also known as cloud-based software. It is like a software that allows data to be accessed from any device via internet and web browser. It plays a massive role in making business applications more flexible and affordable that is really needed for real business process automation. Let's see how Saas is the future of business process automation:</p>
<h2>Single Platform for Many Departments</h2>
<p>Saas products like Google Apps, Dropbox, ZenDesk, etc. have proven helpful for businesses as they create one department for scale. But Saas is the intelligent automation platform that can be used by multiple departments across the industry. Saas allows different workers of the company to perform multiple tasks through cloud deployment. So the companies don't have to get different licenses for different platforms. As workers can perform numerous tasks anytime, Saas can be proved as a time saver for companies. Thus we can say that in the future Saas will take over the small business along with big firms. Steve Fredette, co-founder and President of Toast, says that "SaaS will also take over small business services, where revenue models may shift from purely fixed software models to transaction-based models where you have AWS, Twilio, Zenefits and Gusto as examples today."</p>
<h2>Saas is Flexible and Efficient</h2>
<p>As the business requires new technology consumption models, Saas is there to serve them through cloud computing technology. It is only through Saas that companies are enjoying high levels of freedom and control. Suppose there is an insurance company who is using Saas. Since the company is using Saas, it would be easy for HR to underwrite the information or customers' experience can be automated on the platform. Thus customers can have a pleasant experience with the company since cloud computing simplifies things between both like what customers' requirements are.  Also, digital workers can work from any location and at any time. It won't be wrong to say it is only through Saas that most of the companies are able to handle work from home during this coronavirus pandemic. So Saas is already the need of the hour and if we have to live with this pandemic situation then in the future businesses have to adopt more technologies like Saas.</p>

<h2>Offers No Lengthy Implementation Projects</h2>
<p>The best thing about Saas is that it offers no automation processes. It means once you have decided the method you want to automate, the rest can be done without any additional infrastructure. All you need is a good internet connection, and you are ready to set an online interface anywhere. Due to Saas there is little burden on IT companies in terms of human resources or capital investment. Since Saas allows free license, which means there is no hosting required by client on-or-off site. Businesses don't have to take care of software updates done by the supplier. Thus it requires minimal IT resources, and implementation projects won't be lengthy anymore. It is not that only big IT businesses are using Saas, Saas is also beneficial for other businesses like hotels, grocery stores etc. For example, the needs of the customers can be updated by Saas that he frequently asks for. So grocery stores can also embrace technology like Saas, which means Saas is here to change the traditional working style. </p>
    <br>
<p>To sum up, these were some reasons why Saas is going to be the future of the businesses involved in automation processes. Saas is a business model that already has been adopted by thousands of companies. But it is not the end. It is just the beginning. In future businesses will embrace new technologies like Saas, not out of curiosity but may be due to the need of the hour. All the companies are changing their traditional working styles out of necessities. </p>
